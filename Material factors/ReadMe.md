Mainmat.m performs simulations that show the effects of material factors on the spread of a new technology:
- experiment 1: effects of foresight parameter;
- experiment 2: effects of the maximum benefit of using new technology;
- experiment 3: offects of the minimum benefit of using old technology.
This code uses mainfun.m for creating data.

Figmat.m visualizes the effects of material factors on the spread of a new technology using data files created by Mainmat.m,
and produces Figure 2 in the main text.
