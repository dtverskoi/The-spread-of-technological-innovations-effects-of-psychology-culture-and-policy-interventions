Mainpolicy.m performs simulations that show the effectiveness of five different intervention strategies aming to promote the diffusion of a new technology in a society:
- experiment 1: increasing the effort of the external authority;
- experiment 2: simplifying the exchange of opinions between people;
- experiment 3: increasing the visibility of peer actions;
- experiment 4: material support for early adopters;
- experiment 5: training individuals.
This code uses mainfun.m, mainfunp.m, and mainfunp0.m for creating data.

Figpolicy.m plots all figures in the SM related to intervention strategies using data files produced by Mainpolicy.m.

FigPs.m produces Figure 4 in the main text using data files created by Mainpsych.m
